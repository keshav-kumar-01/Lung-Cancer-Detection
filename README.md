# Lung Cancer Detection

Welcome to the Lung Cancer Detection repository! This project focuses on harnessing the power of deep learning to detect lung cancer using cutting-edge techniques.

## 🚀 Installation

Get started by installing the necessary packages with a single command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.9.0
```

## 💡 Description

Our detection model, crafted with TensorFlow and Keras, employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images efficiently. The dataset comprises images of lung and colon tissues, forming the backbone for training and testing.

## 🛠️ Usage

Train the model effortlessly by running the provided Python script `lung_cancer_detection.py`. Ensure to customize the file paths to match your dataset location. Post-training, evaluate the model's prowess and unleash its predictive capabilities on new data.

## 🔄 Preprocessing

Prior to model feeding, the images undergo preprocessing steps like histogram equalization and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). These steps aim to enrich the images, facilitating the model in effectively capturing essential features.
